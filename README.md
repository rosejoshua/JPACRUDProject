## JPACRUDProject

### Description

This is a fully functional front end website capable of CRUD operations on a SQL database. It is designed as a bulletin-board/message-board. It utilizes Java Persistence API, SpringBoot, Gradle, MySql drivers, among others to allow data manipulation on the back end. Special care was taken to adhere to Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation, and Separation of Concerns. More updates to follow shortly on the front-end when I learn Javascript.

### Topics and Technologies

  * JDBC
  * Spring MVC
  * SpringBoot
  * DispatcherServlet
  * Controller Annotations
  * Component Annotations
  * Autowired Annotations for Dependency Injection
  * Encapsulated Persistence Layer
  * Request Mapping
  * JavaBeans
  * Auto populated Controller Objects from reflection
  * J-Unit tests
  * Dynamically generated Web pages
  * JavaServer Pages
  * Expression Language
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * Hippy Color Schemes


### How to Run

Download all files and set up an appropriately named and populated MySql database. See files for proper naming conventions of database fields. This should get uploaded to AWS in the near future and I will update this README with the IP address once it is done.

### Lessons Learned

Im starting to grasp the flow of information for a fully functional web application. I still need practice setting up the initial naming and connections to be more efficient but I can see how with enough time, I can create a good-looking and fully functional web application. Obvious shortfall in my knowledge-base include the ability to only refresh part of a webpage upon change instead of constantly refreshing entire JSPs. I believe my upcoming education in Javascript with fill some of the gaps. I also need to learn security and how to implement logins in order to determine which views to deliver the user and to restrict and allow specific user functions. This project was a ton of fun, took way longer than it should have but I'm very proud of the final product. I can't wait to expand the functionality as i learn new technologies and get it on my AWS and linked to my domain.
